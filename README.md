GUI for Orca in Computational Chemistry. We need easy Orca.

## Introduction
 This program is a GUI for Orca. Orca is a computational chemistry program, but it is console-based. Since console programs are often difficult for beginners to use, this GUI will make Orca much easier to use.

I developed a GUI based on **Fig 1**, and the result is shown in **Fig 2**. This figure is only a preliminary version, but the overall structure of the GUI will remain the same.
